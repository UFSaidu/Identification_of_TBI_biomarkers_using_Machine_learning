# **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Biomarker Discovery**  

## **Project Progress**  
- Identified **16 key genes** from hippocampus bulk microarray data using **DESeq2** (DEGs), **WGCNA** (co-expression networks), and **PPI** (Protein Network Analysis).
- Performed feature selection using **Lasso, Random Forest (RF), and SVM-RFE** on the 16 key genes, identifying **2 core genes** as optimal TBI biomarkers.  
- **single-cell RNA-seq** validation of the core genes revealed predominant microglia expression, with minimal expression in astrocytes and endothelial cells. The core genes are involved in leukocyte recruitment and microglia activation, driving neuroinflammation and immune cell infiltration post-TBI.
- Performed **Trajectory analysis** on microglia subtypes using **Slingshot** package to identify microglia lineages and map pseudotime injury response.
- Further validation of core genes using  microglia RNA-seq data from the Cortex, incorporating different time-points (acute, subacute, and chronic TBI stages). The core genes exhibited temporal expression patterns across time-points.

## **Next Steps**  
- **Diagnostic potential** of core genes using **GLM, SVM, and XGBoost** with **ROC analysis**.
- **Nomogram construction** for risk prediction.  
- **Calibration & Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)** to assess clinical utility of core genes.
