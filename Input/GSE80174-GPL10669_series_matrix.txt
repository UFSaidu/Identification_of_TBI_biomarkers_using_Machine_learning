!Series_summary	"TBI was induced with lateral fluid-percussion injury in adult male rats. Genome-wide RNA-seq of the perilesional cortex, ipsilateral thalamus and dorsal hippocampus was performed at 3 months post-TBI. The data highlighted chronic transcriptional changes, particularly, in the perilesional cortex and thalamus. Genes showing a significantly altered expression both in the cortex and thalamus were submitted to the LINCS web query to identify novel pharmacotherapies to improve post-TBI outcome."
!Series_overall_design	"TBI was induced to 5 rats, 5 sham operated served as a controls."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1	"The induction of TBI was done according the lateral fluid precussion (LFP) described by McIntosh et al. (1989) and Kharatishvili  et al. (2006). Animals were anesthezied with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a solution (6 ml/kg) containing sodium pentobarbital (58 mg/kg), chloral hydrate (60 mg/kg), magnesium sulphate (127.2 mg/kg), propylene glycol (42.8%) and absolute ethanol (11.6%) and placed in a Kopf stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). The skull was exposed with a midline skin incision followed by extraction of the periosteum. The left temporal muscle was detached from the lateral ridge and then a circular craniectomy (diameter 5mm) was performed over the left parietal lobe midway between lambda and bregma keeping the dura mater intact. The edges of craniectomy were sealed with a modified LuerLock cap that was filled with saline while the calvaria was covered with dental acrylate (Selectaplus CN, Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Dreieich, Germany). Lateral FPI was induced 90 min after the administration of anaesthesia by connecting the rat to a fluid-precussion device (AmScien Instruments, Richmond, VA, USA) via a female Luer-Lock fitting. In this study the main of the impact was 3.32 +/- 0.01 atm. Control animals received anaesthesia and all surgical procedures but without lateral FPI."
